[Jessica Hullman](https://twitter.com/jessicahullman?lang=en) joins us to share her expertise on data visualization and communication of data in the media.  We discuss Jessicaâ€™s work on visualizing uncertainty, interviewing visualization designers on why they don't visualize uncertainty, and modeling interactions with visualizations as Bayesian updates.
